# Zomato Restaurant Review and Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Data science and machine learning analysis focused on restaurant data from Zomato.  
The objective is to analyze restaurant reviews and ratings, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess the data, and build machine learning models to understand rating patterns and predict outcomes effectively.

---

## Problem Statement
Online restaurant platforms like Zomato generate a large volume of customer reviews and ratings.  
Manually analyzing this data is inefficient and error-prone.  
This project aims to:
- Analyze restaurant review data
- Identify key factors influencing ratings
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for prediction

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains restaurant-related information such as:
  - Restaurant ratings
  - Reviews
  - Location and other attributes
- The dataset is preprocessed to handle:
  - Missing values
  - Duplicate entries
  - Irrelevant features

*(Dataset source is used for academic and learning purposes.)*

## Methodology
The project follows a structured data science pipeline:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data cleaning and transformation
   - Feature selection

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical analysis
   - Data visualization
   - Identifying patterns and trends

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical features

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Training machine learning models
   - Evaluating performance using appropriate metrics
   - Selecting the best-performing model

5. **Model Persistence**
   - Saving the trained model using Pickle/Joblib
   - Reloading the model to predict unseen data (sanity check)

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - Jupyter Notebook
